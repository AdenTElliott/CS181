# PA4
This is PA4 of my CS 181 course. 

The purpose of this project is to create a code that will take manager data prompted for the user, and will 
then take that data and calculate the pay of the highest paid manager and the average pay of the managers overall.

**Employee base class:**
made by assignment to assign names and calculate pay of an employee

**Manager derived class:**
made to calculate pay of managers, as well as to calculate each manager's bonus

Uses an array of pointers to gather and store data of multiple managers
